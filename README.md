The Identity Selector Software (thiss.io) is an implementation of the identity selector supported by [the Coalition for Seamless Access](https://seamlessaccess.org/). It implements a discovery service using the RA21.org [recommended practices for discovery UX](https://groups.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/21376/NISO_RP-27-2019_RA21_Identity_Discovery_and_Persistence-public_comment.pdf).

Discovery services are used to facilitate user single sign in for [Federated Identity Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity). This implementation is optimized for the global set of research and education access federations, for example, user sign in to services via their university or institutional login credentials. 

This repository contains the public website for the service which can be found at [https://thiss.io/](https://thiss.io/).
