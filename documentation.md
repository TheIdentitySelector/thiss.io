For an introduction to the thiss software take a look at the [getting started](/gettingstarted/) guide and the [integration guide](/integration/) which provides introduction to the concepts.

Detailed documentation (incl API docs) for all software packages is maintained in each respective software repository and hosted at readthedocs.org

Important documentation include the following:

* [thiss-js](https://thiss-js.readthedocs.org): The discovery service including a Dockerfile for easy deploy.
* [thiss-ds-js](https://thiss-ds-js.readthedocs.org): A set of clients for the discovery service. Can be used to implement a DS connected to a central persistence service.
* [thiss-jquery-plugin](https://thiss-jquery-plugin.readthedocs.org): A jQuery plugin for building search-based identity selectors.
* [this-mdq](https://thiss-mdq.readthedocs.org): An implementation of the metadata query protocol (MDQ) for JSON metadata only. 

In addition there is a repository containing some simple examples illustrating how the various parts of the software suite fits together and can be used: [thiss-examples](https://github.com/TheIdentitySelector/thiss-examples).
